# Angel City (Titanfall 2 map showcase)



This site was made to practice my design skills from scratch. The contents of this site are related to a map update from a game called Titanfall 2. The map was originally released in the first Titanfall game, and fans loved it so much, they remastered the entire map and brought it back in Titanfall 2. This website is a mock website that would hopefully capture the essence of the beauty as well as the hype for this map.

### General Use



There isn't any use to this website other than it being fully responsive to viewable window/screen sizes up 4k displays, as well as as down to an iPhone 6 screen (or any screen size with 375 width pts)



### Future plans



Currently, no future plans for this site, as it wasn't made to be developed, but only to practice my design/color skills. 



### Takeaway



This is my 2nd project with the sole goal of design. There isn't any functionality or cool animations, and while those do spark up a site to make it come to life, I didn't want the, what I think, rather aesthetic appeal of this site to have its merit given to JavaScript/animations, and not from a modern, static design. I was also limited with the photos taken from this site, as there wasn't a lot of screenshots of this map to use. Like my previous design-oriented site, I do plan to make more sites for themes or ideas that I'm passionate about.
